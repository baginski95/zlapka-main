# about project
    Zlapka is final project in our one year bootcamp - Codecool - curiculum. This time we are challenging ouerselves
    to use all obtained skills in creating multi-language (Java EE, plpgsql, C#, Type Script) project based on 
    microservice architecture working in agile methodology. In this approach we are trying to maximize:
    - security
    - usability 
    - modularity
    - interchangeability
